##  Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher recommended
- Basic command-line experience

### Steps to Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rooftop-solar-analyzer.git
   cd rooftop-solar-analyzer
   
2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

4. **Install dependencies:**
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Run the application:**
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py

The app will launch locally and open in the default web browser.

## Usage Guide
Upload a clear satellite or rooftop image in .jpg, .jpeg, or .png format.

The app displays the uploaded image and begins analysis.

Within moments, view:

Usable rooftop area (approximate),

Estimated solar panel capacity in kW,

Predicted daily and yearly energy output in kWh,

Installation cost estimates (₹),

Estimated yearly savings on electricity bills (₹),

Return on Investment (ROI) in years,

A visual indicator suggesting if the investment is good or requires consideration.

## Notes & Limitations
The current version uses simulated calculations to demonstrate functionality.

Real-world application requires integrating AI models (Vision AI) for rooftop detection and segmentation.

All cost and energy figures are approximate and should be calibrated with local data.

This is a prototype to be extended and improved with advanced AI and real satellite imagery APIs.

## Future Improvements & Roadmap
AI Model Integration: Use machine learning to detect rooftop boundaries and shading from satellite images.

Multi-Format Input: Support for geo-tagged images and maps from Google Earth or other providers.

Incentive Data Integration: Pull local and national solar incentives and rebates automatically.

Interactive Mapping: Enable users to select rooftop areas via a map interface.

Advanced ROI Calculator: Include financing options, maintenance costs, and degradation over time.

Performance Optimization: Cache results, parallelize processing for large images.

Deployment: Host as a live app on Hugging Face Spaces, Streamlit Cloud, or similar.
